# Nosse-Manager
Family support case work management plugin for Wordpress.

This plugin is designed to use Wordpress as a framework for a case work management system for family intervention. Currently it requires some paid plugins to fully function but we hope to remove the requirement for these in time.


<b> Paid Plugins Required </b>
* Gravity forms
* WP Data Tables

<b> Database Requirements </b>
We recommend using a non-wordpress database to store the casework information. The plugin uses the following databases-
* Standard wordpress database as defined in wp-config.php
* Extra database to hold data (needs defining in wp-config.php)

$ git tag
v0.2.1
